The purpose of the project is the implementation of a Q-Learning agent on a Grid World environment given the target's ability to move (relatively slow).

The actors of the environment werer slightly modified to fit the q-learning algorithm purposes:
-The Q-learning agent is the class "Bug".
-The (moving) target is the class "Flower".
-The negative-reward block (that the agent must avoid) is the class "Critter".
-The obstacles (blocks that the agent is not allowed to move into) are teh class "Rock".
